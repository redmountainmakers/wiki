# Miter Saw
The miter saw, a.k.a chop saw or drop saw, is a power tool commonly used to make precise crosscuts in various materials- wood, plastic, and specific metals. Since it allows for cutting at various angles, it is also designed for miter cuts, bevel cuts, and compound cuts.

## Safety

- Ensure that the workpiece is securely held against the fence or table and/or clamped down to prevent movement during cutting. This helps maintain control and prevents accidents. 

- Keep your hands at a safe distance from the blade while operating the miter saw. Avoid placing your hands near the cutting area to minimize the risk of injury. **Never** cross your arms while operating the miter saw. One hand should be securing the workpiece a safe distance from the blade while the other hand is operating the saw.

- Always wear safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes from flying debris. Use hearing protection, such as earplugs or earmuffs, to prevent hearing damage.  Consider wearing a dust mask to minimize the inhalation of sawdust.

- Allow the blade to come to a complete stop before raising it or reaching across the cutting area. This reduces the risk of accidental contact with the blade.

- Familiarize yourself with the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines provided in the miter saw's manual. Adhere to all recommended procedures and precautions.

## General Use

- Set the miter angle and bevel angle on the miter saw according to your desired cut. Consult the miter saw's manual for instructions on how to make these adjustments.

- Take accurate measurements and mark the workpiece before making any cuts. Use a tape measure and pencil to ensure precision in your cuts.

- Position the workpiece against the fence and align it with the marked cut line. Double-check the alignment to ensure accuracy. 

- If making multiple cuts of the same length, use a stop block to ensure consistency. A stop block is a piece of scrap wood clamped to the miter saw's fence to act as a guide for the workpiece.

- Switch on the miter saw and allow the blade to reach full speed before making the cut. Always maintain a firm grip on the saw's handle while operating.

- Lower the blade onto the workpiece, keeping your hands clear of the blade and the cutting area. Maintain a controlled motion as you guide the blade through the cut. Avoid forcing the blade or rushing the cut.

- Once the cut is complete, release the power switch and allow the blade to come to a complete stop before lifting it or removing the workpiece.

- Remove cut pieces.  To maintain a clean and safe work environment, either use a hand broom or compressed air to clear the workstation of dust / debris.

- Sawdust collects underneath the miter saw station.  Please use the dustpan and broom to clean up the sawdust after use.

## Unlocking the Miter Saw
- The miter saw has a black pin at the back to lock. This usually is not locked, but in case it is, pull the pin out to release the miter saw.
